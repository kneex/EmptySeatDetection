# Empty Seat Detection in UTS Library with YOLOv5

## Introduction

This project is about developing a real-time computer vision application to accurately detect and highlight empty seats within the UTS Library. The application utilizes deep learning techniques and a customized dataset for training the YOLOv5 machine learning model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was manually created and labeled to ensure high-quality training data for the model. The dataset primarily comprises images of various seating arrangements and statuses within the UTS Library, which helped in accurate empty seat detection.

## Model

The model used in this project is YOLOv5. This model was chosen after comparing the performance of multiple models. YOLOv5 showed superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed, which made it a perfect fit for a real-time application like this.

## Demo

Below is a demonstration of the application. The dynamic GUI designed as part of the project visualizes the location of empty seats on a library floor plan.
